dep-jaeger
=========

An internal/external dependency analyzer for software written in Prolog, useful for a quick overview about the internal structure.

Software's core is written in Prolog, while the GUI is implemented in Java.

This project was developed in the context of the Artificial Intelligence course (taught by <a href="http://lacam.di.uniba.it:8000/people/FlorianaEsposito.html">F. Esposito</a> and <a href="http://lacam.di.uniba.it:8000/~ferilli/ufficiale/ferilli.html">S. Ferilli</a>), MSc in Computer Science, Universit√† degli Studi di Bari 'Aldo Moro'.

dep-jaeger is able to run only on YAP.

Further info are available in the documentation (Italian Only).

## Features

Given a predicate P declared in a module, dep-jaeger can obtain:
- Status of the predicate (exported/not exported).
- File in wich predicate P is contained.
- Number of clauses that compose predicate P.
- Modules used by P.
- Predicates that uses P.
- Predicates used by P.


Given a module A, dep-jaeger can obtain:
- Predicates exported by the module.
- Module (system libraries or user-defined) imported by A.
- Module imported and (un-)used by A.
- File path of every import.
- Potential name clash.
- Real name clash.
- Graphical representation of the internal structure of module A (requires graphviz).
- Graphical representation of modules imported by the module A (requires graphviz).

## Dependencies

Unix/Linux O.S.

YAP 6.2.2 - http://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/vsc/Yap/yap-6.2.2.tar.gz

graphviz - http://www.graphviz.org


## Info


Prolog sources are available both in folder 'prolog' and in folder named 'core' contained in 'dep-jaeger'. 
Java sources are available in folder 'java'.

## Run


First, rename folder 'prolog' in 'core'. This directory needs to be placed in the same path of jarfile.

Then, in terminal, type:  

	$ java -jar jaeger.jar <path-assoluto\\to\\yap>

Also if your prefer console interaction, type:
	
	$ cd //path//to//core//
	$ yap
	$ ['core'].
	$ help.
